# bootcamp-first-project
In this project I was tasked to refract the given code to make it more accessible to screen readers and anyone who'd be handicapped veiwing the website. Through the refracting proccess I cleaned up the code consolidating different classes with same elements into the same group shrinking the overall code and making it easier to navigate through.
